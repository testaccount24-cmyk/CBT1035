This is a beta release of zPipe.

Included are the 10 stages from the document z/OS Piping in 10 Easy
Stages, fully updated and tested, plus some other goodies.
In general, Pipelines and UNIX/Linus compatible stages have
the same names.  REXXified stages will have different names.

The members can be compiled for performance.

Installation options for executing zPipe:

    Which library, .EXEC or .CEXEC:
        - If you have the REXX compiler, use the .CEXEC library.
        - Without the compiler, you may still save on tokenization,
           and/or running external modules.
        - Otherwise use the .EXEC library, especially to see how to
            your own filters.

    Residency (choose one):
        - Copy zPipe members into an existing library.
        - Create a new library to receive the zPipe members.

    Making library executable (choose one):
        - It is the logon proc.
        - It is added to SYSEXEC, e.g. via CONCAT.
        - It is added to the TSO/ISPF screen(s) with ALTLIB.
            Some installations do not isolate ALTLIB between screens.
        - Explicitly execute zPipe; only necessary once per environment:
            exec 'hlq.libname.exec(zPipe)'
            This will display and execute the ALTLIB command needed.
